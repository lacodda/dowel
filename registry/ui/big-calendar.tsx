/*
 * BigCalendar.
 *
 * A month at a time, with what is on each day of it, filling the box it is
 * given.
 *
 * The question a month view is read for is not "what is on the 14th" - a
 * list answers that - but "is that week empty". So the month holds its box:
 * the weeks share the height, a day never grows past its share, and what a
 * day has no room for folds into a count. The count opens the day in place,
 * at the same height with its lines scrolling inside it, so a busy Friday does
 * not push the following week off the screen. One day open at a time: several
 * and the grid stops being a month at a glance, which is the only reason the
 * days fold.
 *
 * What a day holds is the product's: `renderDay` returns its lines, one node
 * each - BigCalendarItem draws one - and the grid decides how many show. The
 * sum is exact rather than estimated, because a line is twenty pixels and two
 * are four apart: the grid measures one day's room and divides.
 *
 * Only the weeks the month touches are drawn, four to six, and the days of the
 * neighbouring months in them are real days on a quieter ground - a release
 * can be dragged onto the 31st of August from the September page. Today is
 * filled with the accent rather than coloured: on a grid of thirty-five cells
 * a coloured digit is not where the eye starts.
 *
 * The month's name and the arrows that turn it are not here. They belong to
 * the screen's head, in one row with its filters and actions, which is where
 * kilna moved them; the grid asks for a new month only when the keyboard walks
 * off its edge.
 *
 * The keyboard is the Calendar's: the grid is one tab stop, the arrows move a
 * cursor through the days, PageUp and PageDown turn the month, and Enter
 * presses the day. Tab from a day goes into it - its add button, then its
 * lines - and then out of the month, because the lines of every other day are
 * out of the tab order: a month holding forty releases is not forty stops.
 *
 * Dragging is the product's. Every day carries `data-day`, so whatever library
 * moves things finds the day under the pointer with `dayOf`, and the handlers
 * go on the calendar itself rather than on forty-two cells. `dropTarget` lights
 * the day something would land on, and `dropHint` says what landing there
 * would mean.
