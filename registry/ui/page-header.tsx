 * PageHeader.
 *
 * What a screen says it is, and the buttons that act on the whole of it: a
 * title, a line under it, and the actions at the far end of the same row.
 * Every screen in the line opens with these three and every one of them set
 * the title in a different size, because `text-lg font-semibold` is the kind
 * of thing nobody looks up.
 *
 * The title is an `h1`. It is the one heading a screen is entitled to: the
 * shell's bar names the application and the rail names the destinations, so
 * this is the top of the content's outline, and a reader jumping by heading
 * lands here. `Container` below is the other half - the measure the content
 * under it is read at.
