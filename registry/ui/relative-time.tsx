/*
 * "3 minutes ago", in the reader's language, over a date they can still read.
 *
 * The rule the component is built on: **relative time is a convenience, never
 * the only copy of the fact.** "Last week" is quicker to read than a date and
 * useless the moment the reader needs to say when something actually happened
 * - and they cannot get it back, because the page has thrown it away. So the
 * element is a `<time dateTime=…>` with the exact moment in its `title`: the
 * machine-readable value stays, hovering shows the real date, and copying the
 * text still yields something a person can act on.
 *
 * `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` writes the phrase, which is the whole reason there
 * is no date library here. "yesterday", "3 недели назад", "in 2 months" - the
 * plural rules and the special words for the nearest units are the part a
 * hand-written version gets wrong first, and it gets it wrong only in the
 * languages its author does not read.
 *
 * What `Intl` does not decide is which unit to use: it is told "3" and
 * "weeks". Choosing between them is `relativeParts` below, and it is the one
 * piece of arithmetic here.
 *
 * Deliberately not self-updating. A component that re-renders every second to
 * keep "2 minutes ago" honest costs a timer per instance - a table of fifty
 * rows is fifty timers - to correct a number nobody is watching change. A
 * product that needs it re-renders the list on its own schedule; the `now`
 * prop is there so it can, and so tests are not written against the clock.

/** The thresholds, largest unit first: how many seconds it takes to earn one,
 * and the unit `Intl` should be handed.
 *
 * A month is 30 days and a year is 365. Both are approximations, and they are
 * the right ones: this is a phrase saying roughly how long ago, and a reader
 * who needs the exact interval is reading the date in the `title` instead. */
