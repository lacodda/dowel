 * TimeField - a time of day, typed the way people say it.
 *
 * No donor for this one: neither product of the line had a time field, so
 * this is written from the same shape as DurationField, and for the same
 * reason. Anything a person plausibly types is accepted - `9`, `9:30`, `930`,
 * `9.30`, `9pm`, `21:30` - and what comes back is always `HH:MM`.
 *
 * The value is `HH:MM` in twenty-four hours, always, no matter how it was
 * typed or how it is shown. That is what a database column holds and what
 * sorts correctly as a string; whether the reader sees `9:30 PM` or `21:30`
 * is a matter of where they live, and `Intl` answers it.
 *
 * Not `<input type="time">`, and the reason is the same as NumberField's: the
 * browser draws its own control, its own spinner and its own clock popup,
 * none of which a stylesheet reaches - so a form of the product's own fields
 * gets one that is visibly not.
 *
 * Empty is `null`, like the other fields here: no time is not midnight.
