/*
 * BigCalendarItem.
 *
 * One thing on a day of a month view, in one line: a release, a lesson, a
 * payment that falls due.
 *
 * One line is the rule the month rests on. BigCalendar folds what a day has
 * no room for into a count, and the count is arithmetic - lines of twenty
 * pixels, four apart - so an item that wraps to two lines on a narrow day
 * breaks the sum and pushes the last line out of the day. The words truncate
 * instead; the whole of them is in `title`, or wherever the product puts a
 * hover card.
 *
 * The colour is the item's own, not the product's: the work it belongs to, the
 * category it is in. Any CSS colour is taken - `var(--series-3)` for a
 * category, the work's own colour where a product keeps one - and drawn as a
 * soft fill with ink leaning towards the theme's text, so the same colour
 * reads on the dark theme and the light one. Without a colour the item is
 * neutral.
 *
 * Two states change how it is drawn, because both are said by kilna's month
 * every day: `tentative` is a plan rather than a booking - a dashed outline,
 * so a suggestion never reads as a fact - and `done` has happened, drawn
 * quieter and still openable, and still readable: a weaker fill and dim ink,
 * not a faded line.
 *
 * It stands outside the month as well: the queue of things waiting for a date
 * beside it, and the copy that travels under the pointer while one is dragged,
 * are the same line.
 */

/**
 * Whether a line stands in the day the month's keyboard is on: `true` there,
 * `false` in every other day, `null` outside a month.
 *
 * The month is one tab stop and the arrows walk its days; Tab from a day goes
 * into that day and then out of the month. So only the lines of the day under
 * the cursor are in the tab order - a month holding forty releases is not
 * forty tab stops. BigCalendarItem reads this itself; a product drawing its
 * own line reads it for the line's `tabIndex`.
