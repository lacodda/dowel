 * ShortcutsDialog.
 *
 * The sheet of every key the application answers to, opened by `?` - written
 * from the list of commands rather than by hand, so it cannot promise a key
 * that does not work.
 *
 * Every hand-written sheet of shortcuts is a version behind what the
 * application actually answers to. This one has no rows of its own: it lists
 * what is declared now, under the headings the commands give themselves, with
 * the keys they answer to after a rebinding and after a conflict. A command
 * declared by the open screen appears while that screen is open, and is gone
 * when it is not.
 *
 * It declares its own command, so `?` opens it with no wiring, the palette
 * offers it, and it lists itself - under the title the product gives it.
 *
 * It opens with the focus on the list rather than on the close button. A sheet
 * is read, not answered: with the focus on the cross, the Enter that someone
 * presses to see what happens closes it, and the arrows that should scroll
 * the list do nothing.
