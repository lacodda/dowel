/*
 * ListDetailScreen.
 *
 * A screen of things and the one that is open: a searchable list beside what
 * is open in it, with the empty states, the keyboard and the narrow width a
 * list needs and every product used to draw for itself.
 *
 * Every product of the line has this screen at least once - works, releases,
 * versions, a queue - and the parts that took each of them longest are not
 * the ones on the stand. They are the three kinds of nothing (none yet, none
 * matching, none open), a keyboard that walks the list the way a mail client
 * does, and a phone, where the list and the open thing take turns and the
 * focus has to follow whichever one is on screen.
 *
 * A block, not a primitive: it lands in the product's `components/blocks` to
 * be read and changed. It is written to be used as it stands all the same -
 * the data and every word come in through props, so a product can keep it
 * unedited for as long as the screen is the usual one, and edit it the day
 * it is not.
 *
 * What it does not own is where the open thing lives. `selected` and
 * `onSelect` are the product's, because in a real product the open thing is
 * an address - `/works/w3` - and the router is the one that knows it.
