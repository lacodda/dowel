/*
 * LoginScreen.
 *
 * The page a product opens on for someone who is not signed in yet: a name,
 * a password, a button, and the two ways it can go wrong said differently -
 * the server refused, or the server could not be reached.
 *
 * Every product of the line with a server drew this, and every one drew it
 * slightly wrong in the same few places. The fields zoomed a phone's page on
 * focus (the set's fields are 16px under a finger now, so this one is too).
 * A refusal and a dead network both said "wrong password", which sends
 * someone whose password is right to reset it. The password manager filled
 * the wrong box, because the name field was not marked `username`. And a
 * second press while the first was still on its way signed in twice.
 *
 * What goes wrong is the product's to say, so `onSubmit` says it: resolve
 * with nothing and the product moves on; resolve with words and they are
 * shown, the password selected so the next attempt types over it; reject,
 * and the screen says `words.failed` - the server is out of reach, which is
 * a different thing from being refused and should read as one.
 *
 * It is the page, so it is the page's `main`: render it outside the frame of
 * the signed-in product, where there is no rail to sit beside.
